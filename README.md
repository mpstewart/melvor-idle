# melvor-idle
`melvor-idle` is a collection of utilities I've authored for the idle game [Melvor Idle](https://melvoridle.com). 

## Compatibility
All scripts in this repository are meant to be run with Tampermonkey. Simply add them as usescripts. I don't think these will work with Greasemonkey.

## Contents

### keybindings.js

Userscript to add a bank toggle to the backtick key

### melvor-edit

A save file editor. Work in progress.
